==============================================================
Msut remove workers from the worker container when worker_run()
exits.

==============================================================
Define signals and behaviour for SUSPEND and RESUME for workers.
A SUSPEND sent to a worker must cause the thread to not take
any processor time until a RESUME is received. I think a SUSPEND
implementation will basically have the worker_run() thread
function sleep for a second (or more) between checking for a
RESUME.
