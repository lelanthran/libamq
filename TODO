==============================================================
Write a specification for the error handler.

==============================================================
Allow anonymous workers; when the name is empty or NULL, make up
a random name for them.

==============================================================
Must replace rlock in containers with actual pthread_rwlock_t
type so that allow multiple readers and only a single writer.

==============================================================
Define signals and behaviour for SUSPEND and RESUME for workers.
A SUSPEND sent to a worker must cause the thread to not take
any processor time until a RESUME is received. I think a SUSPEND
implementation will basically have the worker_run() thread
function sleep for a second (or more) between checking for a
RESUME.
